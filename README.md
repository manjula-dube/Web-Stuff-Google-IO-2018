### Web Components and the Polymer Project: Polymer 3.0 and beyond

* Web Components are powerful, reusable, encapsulated components available natively on the web platform. As web components transition from cutting-edge to table-stakes - directly supported in nearly ever major web browser - the Polymer Project continues to transition as well. 

* In this session, learn about the latest on the web component APIs, the Polymer library's shift to version 3.0, how it's becoming continually smaller and lighter, and the direction the project will be taking in the future.

### Firebase ML Kit (Beta)
* Google brought the whole machine learning power into firebase as ML Kit sdk for Android & IOS. Firebase itself being known for its ease of usage , ML kit will for sure tag along with that.
* It has APIs that allow you to recognize text, faces, scan barcodes, label images and name landmarks along with all these you can run your own Tensorflow Lite models using ML kit by hosting your own models on firebase and using ML kit sdk to interact with it on your apps.

### Build the future of the web with WebAssembly and more 
* WebAssembly is enabling the browsers to expose lower-level primitives that can be built on by developers to create performance demanding functionality, like real time media processing, without having to wait for it to be standardized and implemented.
