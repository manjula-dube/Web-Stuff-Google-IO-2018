### PWA starter kit: build fast, scalable, modern apps with Web Components ###

* Since PWA is killing the native world the first talk I liked the most was "Starter kit for PWA". If you are newbie just getting to build your first PWA app you should definitely try this.

### Web Components and the Polymer Project: Polymer 3.0 and beyond

* Web Components are powerful, reusable, encapsulated components available natively on the web platform. As web components transition from cutting-edge to table-stakes - directly supported in nearly ever major web browser - the Polymer Project continues to transition as well. 

* In this session, learn about the latest on the web component APIs, the Polymer library's shift to version 3.0, how it's becoming continually smaller and lighter, and the direction the project will be taking in the future.
